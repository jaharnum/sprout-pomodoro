# Sprout Pomodoro

* A simple pomodoro timer that rewards the user by showing a flourishing plant grow!

* Start timer - seed planted
* Start break 1 - water and sprout appears
* Start timer 2 - sprout grows a new leaf!
* Start break 2 - water and stem grows woody, more leaves
* Start timer 3 - big plant! sparkles! You did it for an hour!
* After this, breaks simply have the add water animation

* Let's see how annoying it is to create these images and animations before committing to more than 3 stages but it would be cool to have a bud grow into a flower or a neat bug come by or some additional things

### Colours:
* background comforting brown like dirt? blue like sky?
* comforting browns: 5E3D2F, 3D261D (darker)
* opposing greens for plant: 142A21, 13392A, 204033, 2D5746 (dark to light)
* nice blue for sky: #B2E0EB, #D3EBF3 (properly light for black text), 217285, 288297 (dark and moody)
